Optimization Issues
================

\[
  \Psi(\lambda, h, g) = \frac{1}{x_{max}-x_{min}} ( \sum_x [\ln\frac{1}{1-q_x} - \frac{h}{g}e^{gx}(e^g-1)-\lambda ] )^2
\]

For simplicity, Set \[
  R = x_{max}-x_{min}  \\
  Q = \sum_x \ln\frac{1}{1-q_x} \\
  H = \frac{h}{g}(e^g-1)
\]

So, \[
  \Psi(\lambda, h, g) = \frac{1}{R} ( Q - R\lambda - H\sum_x e^{gx} )^2
\]

Note that \(\lambda\) here has minimal interaction with any of the
obesrvations. Itâ€™s actually quite trivial to show that to minimize
\(\Psi\) on \(\lambda\) we set \(\lambda\) to minimum of its range (i.e.
\(\lambda \rightarrow 0\)) Additionally, if we used equation (10):
